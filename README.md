# flushtheturds
gtav solo session


GTAV is full of griefers and script kiddies.

There is a trick to force the game to drop you into a solo, but still public, multiplayer session.
By temporarily suspending the GTA process, the netcode times out and disconnects you from your current session.
This process is known as "flushing the turds".

The flushtheturds.exe utility can automate this process for you.
To use, simply alt-tab out of the game and run flushtheturds.exe.
A progress bar appears and counts down;  after ~12 seconds you can return to GTA to find you have been placed in a solo session.
